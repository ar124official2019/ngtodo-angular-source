# ngtodo-angular-source
Source of my Todo application built using Angular

This app is part of my learning Journy! I created this app for challanging my NodeJS and Angular skills.

# About App
This is a simple todo application for creating Todos! This would run on any local server to be in action. This is not to be deployed, but if you find it useful, you may clone and tweak it to be deployed!

WARNING! THIS IS NOT A SECURE APPLICATION TILL NOW. May be later I would add HTTPS support and encoding/decoding of data while to be sent/received to/from but if you want(I would really encourage you as well as feel encouraged myself), you may improve its security and make a pull request!
