# ngtodo-angular-source
Source of my Todo application built using Angular

This app is part of my learning Journy! I created this app for challanging my NodeJS and Angular skills.

# About App
This is a simple todo application for creating Todos! This would run on any local server to be in action. This is not to be deployed, but if you find it useful, you may clone and tweak it to be deployed
